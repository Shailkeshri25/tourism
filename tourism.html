            INTRODUCTION <CENTER><BR>
            North Bengal can be broadly divided in three sections.
            They can be classified as the hills including Darjeeling,
            Kalimpong, Kurseong and Mirik, the plains of Cooch Behar
            and Malda and the last section is the Terai region
            consisting of Dooars which is the stretch from of the
            foothills of Himalaya. We are based in Siliguri in the
            district of Darjeeling. Siliguri is the gateway to the
            whole of northeast India and includes seven state four
            neighboring countries. Nepal, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Tibet, and China have their International trading route through
            Siliguri. Ideally located and well connected by (Bagdogra
            International Airport (IXB), Railways with New Jalpaiguri
            Station (NJP) and Siliguri Town Station and by Roadways
            Tenzing Norgay Bus Terminus. National Highway number 31
            passes through this town and it is further branched to
            Darjeeling as national highway number 55, Sikkim and
            Kalimpong is connected vide national highway number 31 A,
            Dooars and Guwahati by national highway number 31. The main
            reason for its growth is its strategic location. Tea,
            Tourism, Timber, Table Tennis, Transport and Trading might
            be the possible reason for the growth of Siliguri. Hill
            stations are all two to 4 hours drive from Siliguri and
            the wildlife in north Bengal is worth visiting. There
            are at least half a dozen national park and sanctuary in
            any of the stretches passing through Siliguri.
